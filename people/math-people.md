## Aristotle
(384—322 BCE), Greece. Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidiki, in the north of Classical Greece. Along with Plato, Aristotle is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy", which inherited almost its entire lexicon from his teachings, including problems and methods of inquiry, so influencing almost all forms of knowledge. Aristotle set the roots of formalised logic.

## Turing
Alan Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Russell
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), English. Phylosophy, Logic, Logicism. With Whitehead "Principia".

## Post
Emil Post (February 11, 1897 – April 21, 1954) was an American mathematician and logician. He is best known for his work in the field that eventually became known as computability theory.

## Euclid
Euclid of Alexandria (325–265 BCE), Egypt. For Euclid, mathematics consists of proofs and constructions.

## Al-Khwarizmı
Al-Khwarizmı (c.780–850), Baghdad. For him, mathematics consists of calculations.

## Leibniz
G. W. Leibniz
(1646–1716), Germany. Calculate whether a proof is correct. _Calculemus_: according to Leibniz, we can calculate whether a proof is correct. This will need a suitable language (a universal characteristic) for writing proofs.

## Frege
- Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848-1925), Germany.
- philosophy, logic, math
- father of analytic philosophy, philosophy of language and math
- widely ignored during his lifetime (re-intro by Peano and Russell)
- contributions to development of modern logic with "Begriffsschrift"
- foundations of mathematics with "Foundations of Arithmetic"

His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn.

Frege invented a universal characteristic in 1879; he called it "Begriffsschrift". With it, Frege introduced propositional and predicate calculus.


## Gentzen
Gerhard Gentzen (1909–1945), Germany. Gentzen's system of natural deduction allows us to write proofs in a way that is mathematically natural. (he didn't went crazy but Nazi).

## Poincaré
Jules Henri Poincaré
[Jules Henri Poincaré](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9) (1854-1912),
French mathematician, physicist, engineer, philosopher.
"The Last Universalist" for he excelled in all fields of math as it existed during his lifetime. The Poincaré conjecture, the Poincaré group, three-body problem, chaos theory, topology, gravitational waves.

## Łukasiewicz
Jan Łukasiewicz (1878-1956), Poland    
Logician and philosopher born in Lemberg, a city in the Galician kingdom of Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine). His work centred on philosophical logic, mathematical logic, and history of logic. He thought innovatively about traditional propositional logic, the principle of non-contradiction and the law of excluded middle. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Łukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Łukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley - which inform modern translations of Prior Analytics by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009. Łukasiewicz is regarded as one of the most important historians of logic.

## Kleene
Stephen Cole Kleene
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene
(January 5, 1909 – January 25, 1994) was an American mathematician.

One of the students of Alonzo Church, Kleene, along with Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of mathematical logic known as recursion theory, which subsequently helped to provide the foundations of theoretical computer science.

Kleene's work grounds the study of computable functions. A number of mathematical concepts are named after him: Kleene hierarchy, Kleene algebra, the Kleene star (Kleene closure), Kleene's recursion theorem and the Kleene fixpoint theorem. He also invented regular expressions, and made significant contributions to the foundations of mathematical intuitionism.

## Church
Alonzo Church
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church
(June 14, 1903 – August 11, 1995) was an American mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematical logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is best known for the lambda calculus, Church–Turing thesis, proving the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, Frege–Church ontology, and the Church–Rosser theorem. He also worked on philosophy of language.


## Peano
- Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), Italian
- published 200+ math papers and books
- a founder of mathematical logic
- contributed a lot to mathematical notation
- key contributions to the rigorous and systematic treatment of induction
- *Peano axioms* - standard axiomatization of naturals named in his honor
- tought math at the University of Turin
