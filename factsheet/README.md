# Factsheet


# Sperm bandwidth
Male ejaculates about 300 million sperm cells within 5 seconds. The DNA in each cell consists of 3 billion base pairs, each storing 2 bits of information. This means that a human ejaculation has a bandwidth of about 40.000 terabytes/sec.

# Events :: Timeline :: History
- Big Bang was 13.8 billion years ago.
- Earth's habitable epoch happend when the age of the universe was 10-17 million years.


# Speed of light
* 299,792,448 m/s
- light travels 22 cm in 0.3 ns
  (CPU at 3.2 GHz has a cycle of 0.3 ns)
- It takes light 1.26 seconds to travel from the Earth to the Moon.
- Speed of electrons in a circuitry 50-90% of light speed (probably 90% for gold conductors)



## Evolution
Timeline of the evolutionary history of life
https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life

There are about 250,000 generations between *Pan Troglodytes* (ape) and *Homo Sapiens*, i.e. we shared the last common ancestor some 1/4 millions of generations ago.


## Relativity
**Doppler effect**: car moving towards you sounds high pitched cuz sound waves are short, compressed. as it passes you sound waves gets more stretched having lower and lower pitch. Same with light, blue is short wave, red is longer, stretched wave. For infinite number of observers moving at the different speed, all these realities exist at the same time. One observer only sees one, his own, reality, all others realities exists, but they're unrealized for him. The set of all observers each experiencing his reality, amount to that many realites.


# Earth
- Age of Earth: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Age_of_the_Earth
- Earth's habitable epoch happend when the age of the universe was 10-17 million years.

- 4.54 billion years ago: birth of the Earth
- 3.5 billion years ago: the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth
- 2.4 billion years ago: Great Oxygenation Event
- 440 million years ago: End of the Ordovician:
  86% of all species lost, including graptolites
- 375 million years ago: Late Devonian
  75% of species lost, including most trilobites
- 251 million years ago: End of the Permian, "The Great Dying"
  96% of species lost, including tabulate corals, most extant trees, synapsids
- 200 million years ago: End of the Triassic
  80% of species lost, including all of the conodonts
- 66 million years ago: End of the Cretaceous
  76% of species lost, including all of the ammonites, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and nonavian dinosaurs

_Eons_
- Hadean:      4000 Ma - earlier
- Archean:     4000 Ma - 2500 Ma
- Proterozoic: 2500 Ma - 542 Ma
- Phanerozoic:  542 Ma - present

Proterozoic eras:
- Palaeoproterozoic
- Mesoproterozoic
- Neoproterozoic

Phanerozoic eon contains 3 _eras_ divided by major mass extinctions:
- Paleozoic:    542 Ma - 251.0 Ma
- Mesozoic:   251.4 Ma - 66 Ma
- Cenozoic:      66 Ma - present

Paleozoic _periods_:
- Cambrian
- Ordovician
- Silurian
- Devonian
- Carboniferous
- Permian

Mesozoic periods:
  - Triassic
  - Jurassic
  - Cretaceous

- 6.5 Ma First hominins
- 1.2 Ma Evolution of Homo antecessor
- 600 ka Evolution of Homo heidelbergensis
- 350 ka Evolution of Neanderthals
- 250 ka Anatomically modern humans appear in Africa.
  - Around 50,000 years ago they start colonising the other continents, replacing the Neanderthals in Europe and other hominins in Asia.
- 30 ka Extinction of Neanderthals



# Life
- Scientific evidence suggests that life began on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago.
- The earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland.
- Also microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.
- More recently, in 2015, "remains of biotic life" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.

More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.

Earth's current species estimate: 10-14 million
- of which about 1.2 million have been documented 
- over 86 percent have not yet been described.
- However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described.


# Animals
- Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described
- of which around 1 million are insects
- estimate: over 7 million animal species in total.
- Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres

Cambrian explosion began ~542 million years ago.
- 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified
- these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.



## Humans

Human body is colonized by many microorganisms.

Human microbiota (reference: male, 70kg, 170cm)
- 37.2 trillion human cells
- 100 trillion bacterial cells

Ratio of non-human to human cells
- traditional estimate [wrong]: 10:1
- modern estimate: 3:1, or even 1:1


**Gastric acid** is one of the main secretions of the stomach. It consists mainly of *hydrochloric acid*.
