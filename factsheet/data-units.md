# Data units


## Proper
Proper data units are base 2, meaning that magnitude scale by 1024, not the usual 1000 (10^3) as for base 10 numbers. 2^10 ~ 10^2


common prefixes for magnitutes are 

(not base 10). Playing dumb by using base 10 numbers for capacity was incorrect but looked better


Using base 10 instead of base 2 units gives excuse to companies to lie about the actual storage size.

For example, buying a HDD whose declared capacity is 1 TB, you get only 931 GiB


Units: bit, byte
Magnitudes (SI)   : kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, peta, exa,  zeta, yotta
Magnitudes (wrong): kilo, mega, giga, tera, pebi, exbi, zebi, yobi
Factors: 8, 1024, (1000)
