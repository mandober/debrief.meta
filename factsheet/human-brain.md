# Human brain

Human brain (estimates):
- internal clock: 200 Hz
- axon speed: 100 m/s
- number of neurons: 100 billion
- number of synapses: 800 trillion - 1 quadrillion
- power usage: 23.2 W (based on a 2400 calorie per day diet)

Human brain works at (its internal clock): ~200 Hz
The speed of axons: 100 m/s

The human brain has an estimated 100 billion neurons each with up 10,000 synaptic connections - or a total of some one quadrillion synapses - yet operates on less power than a lightbulb.

The brain makes up 2% of a person's weight. Despite this, even at rest, the brain consumes 20% of the body's energy. The brain consumes energy at 10 times the rate of the rest of the body per gram of tissue. The average power consumption of a typical adult is 100 Watts and the brain consumes 20% of this making the power of the brain 20 W.

Diet of 2400 calorie = 2400 kcal
2400 kcal/24 h = 100 kcal/h = 27.8 cal/s = 116.38 J/s = 116 W
20% of 116 W = 0.2*116 = 23.2 W

## Reaction time/access time
The average reaction time of a human is ~ 0.25s = 250ms

## Neural networks: number of synapses

- Human brain: ~8e14 synapses (800 trillion)
- IBM's TrueNorth chip: ~16e9 (16 billion) using 64 by 4,096 cores
- Intel's Loihi chip: ~30 million synapses

| Neural network | sn   |  number of synapses | same as      |
|----------------|------|--------------------:|--------------|
| Human brain    | 8e14 | 800 000 000 000 000 | human brain  |
| IBM TrueNorth  | 16e9 |      16 000 000 000 |              |
| Intel Loihi    | 13e7 |         130 000 000 | mole's brain |

The first iteration of the Loihi chip, made in 14 nm fabrication process, houses 128 clusters, each with 1,024 artificial neurons, for a total of 131,072 simulated neurons.
