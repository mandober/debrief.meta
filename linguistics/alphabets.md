# Alphabet

**Alphabet** is a standard set of *letters* (basic written *symbols* or *graphemes*) that represent the *phonemes* (basic significant sounds) of any spoken language it is used to write.

This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographic systems (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).

grapheme is a basic written symbol



A symbol is a mark, sign or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for "STOP".

**Latin alphabet** or **Roman alphabet** was adapted from the *Etruscan alphabet* during the 7th century BCE. Since then it has had many different forms, and been adapted to write many other languages.

According to a legend, Latin alphabet was created by adapting a variant of Greek alphabet.
