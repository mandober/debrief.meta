# Alphabet

**Alphabet** is a standard set of graphemes, which try to represent the phonemes of a language in writing.

**Graphemes** or **letters** are the basic written symbols of a language.

**Phonemes** are the basic significant sounds of a language. Their analog in writing are *syllables*.

A **symbol** is a representation (mark, sign, word, etc.) that indicates or signifies a concept (notion, object, relation, abstraction, etc.). Symbols allow people to go beyond their individual knowledge by creating links between concepts and experiences (ideas, objects). All forms of communication are realized through the use of symbols.

Symbols convey ideas and beliefs taking many forms including sounds, words,gestures, ideas, images, objects. For example, a red octagon symbolizes the command to stop the vehicle, having the equivalent power as if the order to stop has been given by an official authority.
